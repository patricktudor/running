    "\n",
    "These need to be compiled so these requests can take a while. They both send a link to your email address for you to retrieve the data. For me, Strava took about 5 mins, Garmin took about 20 mins. After having a quick look through both folders, Strava seems a lot more intuitive to understand, so for now I'll focus on files from there.\n",

    "- `gpx` - routes and some activities are stored as this\n",
